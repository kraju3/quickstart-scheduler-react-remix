## Overview

v3-scheduler repository is a sample reposiroty to test scheduler editor and NylasSchedulingComponent

It supports

- Standard Editor Flow: Requires the user to re-authenticate.
- Access Token Flow: The user has previously authenticated within the same origin and has an access token associated with that origin.
- No Auth Flow: If an account has been authenticated previously, you can use the editor without re-authentication.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

- `build/server`
- `build/client`
